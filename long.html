    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
    <p>A project completed for The Stanford Longevity Design Challenge with a team of students from Design Consulting at Cornell. We designed a gardening app to encourage urban dwellers interact with their physical environment.   </P>

    <h2> Problem </h2>
    <p>How can we <strong> motivate and educate urban dwellers on gardening </strong> so that they are able to interact with their physical space thus promoting a healthier lifestyle? </p>
    
    <h2> Solution </h2>
    <p>
    An gardening app that utilizes daily to-dos, check-ins, plant growing in a virtual space, and personalized plant kits to <strong> help bridge knowledge gaps </strong> and motivate the user to grow a plant successfully.</p>
    
    <h2> User Research </h2>
    <div class="three-column">
      <div class="columns1">
        <h3>Survey</h3>
        <p>A survey <strong> gauging interest and pain points </strong> was sent out across various internet platforms, such as Facebook and Reddit.</p>
    </diV>
    <div class="columns2">
      <h3> User Interviews</h3>
      <p>
    Interviews were conducted to better <strong> understand how people interact with their environment</strong> and how gardening may change that.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="columns3">
    <h3>Synthesis</h3>
    <p>Our findings were sorted into an <strong> affinity diagram </strong> to categorize user interests and needs.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    <h3> Survey Findings </h3>
    
    <p>From the survey we were able to conclude that <strong> 94% of our participants had a high interest </strong> in attempting to garden or had gardened in the past. Additionally, we were able to conclude that<strong> 39.9% of participants ranked time</strong> as one of their top pain points with <strong> space and lack of knowledge making up 23% and 16.9% </strong> of participants respectively. </p>

        <p><strong>
    Who are the interviewees:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Those who live in urban/suburban areas</li>
      <li>Those with gardening experience</li>
      <li>Those who may not have had the opportunity to garden</li>

    <div class="column2">
      <p><strong>
    What are the goals of the interviews:</strong> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand how urban/suburban lifestyles affect well-being</li>
      <li>Understand how gardening can affect well-being</li>
      <li>Determine why those interested in gardening have not started </li>

    <h3> Synthesis</h3>
    <p>
    From the findings from the survey we generated an affinity diagram by grouping user information in several different iterations.Then these categories were recategorized into positive and negative groups.  </p>

    <h3> Key Findings </h3>

    <P><strong>User Interviews showed that many people viewed gardening as:</strong></p>

      <li>Lack of motivation</li>
      <li>Difficulty in managing </li>

     <p><strong> Our findings reflected problems occurring in urban areas:</strong> </p>

    <h2> Medium-Fi Iterations</h2>
    
    <h3> To-Do List Feature</h3>
    <p>
    Through user research, it was discovered that one of the pain points of users was lack of time. Thus a <strong> to-do list design that would effectively address the tasks </strong> the user needed to complete in order to keep their plants healthy was iterated on. The goal was to create an accessible design with laid out tasks that would <strong> lower the amount of time </strong> the user spent attempting to care for the plant.  </p>
    
    <div class="grow-medium">
    <div class="three-column">
      <div class="columns1">
    <h3>First Iteration </h3>
    <img  src="public/images/grow-todo-first.png" alt="Circles Logo">
    <p>
    This iteration shows the daily to-do and a weekly progress on water, sun, and growth. However, keeping the knowledge gap in mind, <strong> this design could cause users to over-water </strong> their plant the first day of the week in order to complete their weekly process. Thus this design could result in the user not being able to successfully grow the plant. </p>
    
      </div>
      <div class="columns2">
    <h3> Second Iteration </h3>
    <img  src="public/images/grow-todo-second.png" alt="Circles Logo">
    <p>The second iteration shows the daily water, sun, and fertilizer in a more pictorial way. This design worked well to <strong> break the individual tasks down by day </strong> of the week. However, the knowledge gap still wasn’t fully filled as the tasks for the user might need to be broken down into <strong> more specific and descriptive tasks.</strong> </p>
      </div>
      <div class="columns3">
    <h3> Final Design </h3>
    <img  src="public/images/grow-todo-final.png" alt="Circles Logo">
    <p>
    The final design was the <strong> simplest </strong>, but <strong> provided users with the lowest learning curve </strong> because it provided the most information about plant care and laid it out in a way that wouldn’t overcomplicate the steps. This allowed the user to become more knowledgeable and reduce the amount of time it took to take care of the plant.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    
    <h3> Charity Donation Feature </h3>
    <p> During medium-fi, an iteration of the charity donation page was created, which <strong> aims to motivate users </strong> to grow their plant successfully. </p>
    <div class="grow-medium2">
    <div class="two-column">
    <div class="column1">
    <h3> First Iteration </h3>
    <img  src="public/images/grow-charity-first.png" alt="Circles Logo">
    <p>
    This first version of the charity page uses a drop-down menu for a <strong>minimalistic </strong> look. It also makes it very <strong> intuitive </strong> to the user that clicking on the charity means you are choosing it to donate. </p>
    
    </div>
    <div class="column2">
    <h3> Final Design </h3>
    <img  src="public/images/grow-charity-final.png" alt="Circles Logo">
    <p> In the final version, the charities were showcased with more visibility. This <strong> provided context for the users </strong> as the logos and charity taglines allow the users to briefly view what the charity is about before deciding to learn more about it. This page allowed the user to <strong> gather information </strong> about the charities <strong> at a glance </strong> rather than needing to click through each one.  </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="grow-medium2">
    <h2> Profile Profile </h2>
    <div class="two-column">
      <div class="column1">
        <h3> First Iteration</h3>
        <img  src="public/images/grow-profile-first.png" alt="Circles Logo">
        <p>In the first version, the design was focused on creating an easy <strong> landing page for the user to navigate to other pages from </strong>. The user needed the ability to buy a new plant and see their garden which was integral to the user experience, and putting that on the profile page would reinforce that need. However, this iteration was not meeting the user’s pain points of lack of time, lack of knowledge, and lack of motivation. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column2">
        <h3> Final Iteration</h3>
        <img  src="public/images/grow-profile-final.png" alt="Circles Logo">
        <p>The profile page was approached from two different angles, which creates quite a differentiation in design iterations. At first, the user’s need for easy access and navigation was tackled; however, upon reflection it made more sense to <strong> target the user’s motivation pain point </strong>. Thus the design incorporates motivators such as levels rather than easy access links. </p>

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <p>This project helped me learn some technical UX skills and exposed me to software like Figma and whimsical. Prior to this project, I has no experience working in high-fi or prototyping and I has the opportunity to experiment with both during this project. </p>
