     <p> <b>Hi, I'm Caitlyn,</b></p>
        <p> and I am a junior studying Information Science with a concentration in User Experience Design at Cornell University. I became passionate about UX design through a variety of my courses at school that discuss the importance of making design clear, understandable, and accessible. I have begun divining into this interest through my Design Consulting Club. This experience has allowed me to gain real-life UX experience and work with clients to create specialized technology solutions that meet a specific user's needs. Through this opportunity, I have been able to design several products for varying clients. Additionally, I have two internships that have given me the oppunrtunity to work on design projects. I worked at one start up where I created wire frames conducted rsearch, and created instagram mockups. My other internship gave me the oppuruntiy to work on a compnay project for Girls Who Code. We conducted a gap analysis and found areas in the UI of the current project that needed improves and iterated high-fi solutions in Figma </p>


        <p> Outside of my design work, I am interested in art, fashion, and music. I could talk to someone for hours about the Met Gala and always love to tune into fashion week. Moreover, I love curating playlists for friends and listening to new music. I also like to workout and go to the gym to lift weights and run. </p>
