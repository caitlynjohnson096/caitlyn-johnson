        <strong>Overview</strong>
        <p>An exploratory UX project meant to address a problem through the lens of entertainment. This project was completed with a team of classmates with the intent of us learning more about the design process.  </p>

    <h2> Problem </h2>
    <p> College graduates are not currently afforded an effective way to engage in social activities and make friends organically through shared interests and backgrounds amongst people in their new city.</p>
    <h2> Solution </h2>
      <p> An app that allows people to join groups called circles that <strong> promote activities and friendships within a certain hobby space </strong> . Additionally, this app also largely depends on its <strong>map feature </strong>, which allows users to interact with friends and events nearby based upon current location.</p>
    
      <h2> User Research </h2>
    
      <h3> Methods </h3>
    <div class="two-column">
      <div class="column1">
      <p>Interviewees:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Recent college graduates (undergraduate and graduate)
        </li>
        <li>Students within three years of graduation moving for job offers </li>
        <li>Not including graduates working remotely or in their hometown </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="column2">
      <p>Interview Goals:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Learn about past moving experiences </li>
        <li>Identify fears and anxieties surrounding moving</li>
        <li>Understand interviewees priorities when it comes to settling down </li>
        <li> Learn how participants socialize and make friends in a new city  </li>

    <h2> Ideation </h2>
    <h3> Storyboarding </h3>
    <p>The key findings from user-research provided a jumping off point for the ways that technology could be leveraged to help recent college graduates. The team then used this research to<strong> generate storyboards</strong> to tell the struggle of post-grads and <strong> how technology could be used to support that process.</strong> </p>
    <img  src="images/storyboard.png" alt="Circles Logo">
    <h3> The Idea </h3>
    <p> Users can choose to <strong> join “circles”</strong>, which are <strong> similar to group chat channels based on commonalities </strong>such as work and hobbies through a mobile app interface. Additionally, <strong>relevant events are suggested weekly to these circles</strong>, and users can indicate if they are going as well as see who else is interested. </p>
    <h2> User Testing </h2>
    
    <div class="two-column">
      <div class= "column1">
      <img  src="images/circles-user-test.png" alt="Circles Logo">
    </div>
    <div class="column2">
      <h3> Methods </h3>
      <p> Facebook messenger was used to test the functionality and engagement of the app that we wanted to prototype. We aimed to <strong> test the high priority risks </strong> of the app such as users not being able to arrange schedules to go to events together, the awkwardness of meeting a group of new people, and safety concerns. We had the users <strong>interact with messenger by asking them to join circles, choose events they wanted to check, and request new events. </strong>  </p>
      <h3> Findings </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>AI did not provide them with enough information to understand what a circle is </li>
        <li>Users reported that they felt most comfortable meeting up with other users who had a profile picture available</li>
        <li>The affordances that Facebook provides for sending individual messages confused the user </li>
        <li> Users were more likely to attend an event if it was within a reasonable distance and was priced within their budget </li>
      </ol>
