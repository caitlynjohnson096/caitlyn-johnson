    <h2> Problem </h2>
    <p>Quantum AI has <strong> developed a back-end algorithm </strong> with artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics, but they <strong> don't have a front-end interface</strong> to complement it. Thus we must create an interface/database that allows those using software to view data, manipulate data, and see how well the algorithm is performing. </p>
    <h2> Solution </h2>
    <p>A web-app that securely stores data sets utilizing internal sharing tools, and allows that data to be manipulated and visually represented using <strong> customizable variables </strong>and axes. </p>
    <h2> Competitor Research</h2>

    <p>
    In order to understand the place that Quantum AI was located in the market, we conducted competitor research. We did so by <strong> reviewing UI across competitor sites as well as looking for user feedback on the internet </strong>. This allowed us to understand the design conventions used across fraud detection services and evaluate them on their effectiveness. The three most useful competitors that we viewed were Ekata, Sift, and Riskfield.</p>

        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> Reached out to people in the industry via LinkedIn</li>
          <li>Asked questions about work flow and pain points in day to day work </li>
          <li>Sorted the data using an affinity diagram </li>
          <li>Used key insights to generate user personas </li>

    <h3> Key Takeaways </h3>

    <img  src="public/images/qa-keytakeaways.png" alt="Circles Logo">
    </div>
    <p> Throughout the process of interviewing users it was difficult to find users willing to interview as my fraud analyst <strong> fear sharing intimate details about the job </strong> causing security concerns. However, this indicated that the <strong> users value privacy. </strong></p>
    
    
    <h3> Persona </h3>

    <h2> Ideation </h2>

    <h2>User Flow </h2>
    <p>
    After ideating and conducting user research, we synthesized this research into a user flow that outlined what pages we would need to design and how the user could use different features to navigate from page to page. </p>

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <p> This project taught me how you have to be flexible when using the design process as not every project has the same entry point and the same blockers. This project in particular forced me to reconsider my approach to user research. It was quite challenging to access fraud analysts who were willing to interview for this project, and I should have shifted the team's approach from reaching out to fraud analysts on LinkedIn to instead interviewing people who work on data heavy web-apps and work with data visualizations. While these are not directly the target users they still have experience relevant to this project and could have still provided insight on our users needs.</p>
