<h2> Problem </h2>
<p> Clarks Auto Body Repair Shop’s website has usability issues, navigation issues, and doesn’t properly fit users needs, so how might we generate user appropriate content in a intuitive user flow? </p>

<h3> Key Findings </h3>

<h2> Site Planning and Organization  </h2>

<h3> Card Sort </h3>

<h3> Visual Theme </h3>
<p> Next we considered various visual themes for our site. Our first idea was to use a red and black theme to generate a sleek look for the website, and in this design a majority of the "white space" would be black. We also were considering a theme that was blue, black, and white to differentiate this auto-body site from one that currently exists on the internet, which would possibly allow the site to stick out. However, we ended up deciding to go with a black and red theme on a white background. This theme would also include easily readable font, as well as, decorative images of the team working to engage the users and build their trust in the shop </p>

          <p> After finishing this project some of the key takeaways are learning to implement interactivity that improves the user experience. In this project, the reviews section that had interactivity added to it as a view more/less button was not well-designed as it did not improve the user experience. The goal of this interactivity was to decrease the amount of scrolling that a user had to do. This is because the reviews took up a lot of space on the page and were quite repetitive; however, by shorening each indivual review the overall going of deceasing respitivness, and the amount of space that these reviews took up was lost. Therefore, for future project it is important to keep in mind when using javascript that the design of the   page we are implementing musst benefit the user in some way. </p>
