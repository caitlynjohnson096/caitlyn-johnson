<h2> Problem </h2>

<h3> Key Findings </h3>

<h2> Site Planning and Organization  </h2>

<h3> Card Sort </h3>
<p> In order to figure out how to arrange the content in a way that worked for the user we conducted card sorting.
  We made cards with the most important content for the site and conducted several iterations to find the organization for the users. </p>

</p>
<h3> Visual Theme </h3>
<p> Next we considered various visual themes for our site. Our first idea was to use a red and black theme to generate a sleek look for the website, and in this design a majority of the "white space" would be black. We also were considering a theme that was blue, black, and white to differentiate this auto-body site from one that currently exists on the internet, which would possibly allow the site to stick out. However, we ended up deciding to go with a black and red theme on a white background. This theme would also include easily readable font, as well as, decorative images of the team working to engage the users and build their trust in the shop </p>

<h2> User Testing </h2>
<p> The user testing for this website was conducted by having a number of our potential users interact with the coded prototype of the site.
As they walked through the site, we watched where they clicked what they struggled with and asked them to talk through their thoughts. 
From watching our users, we are able to identify which parts of the site are difficult for the users to navigate to and how the layout, color, 
and interactivity affects the user experience.

          <p> After finishing this project some of the key takeaways are learning to implement interactivity that improves the user experience. In this project, the reviews section that had interactivity added to it as a view more/less button was not well-designed as it did not improve the user experience. The goal of this interactivity was to decrease the amount of scrolling that a user had to do. This is because the reviews took up a lot of space on the page and were quite repetitive; however, by shorening each indivual review the overall going of deceasing respitivness, and the amount of space that these reviews took up was lost. Therefore, for future project it is important to keep in mind when using javascript that the design of the   page we are implementing musst benefit the user in some way. </p>
